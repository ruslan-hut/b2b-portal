The wide selection of designs allows you to quickly and easily create any pattern.<br><br><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong><br>- High-quality engraving ensures comfortable use;<br>- Makes it possible to create even complex designs without drawing skills;<br>- For best results, we recommend using with DARK STAMPING POLISH and DARK Stamping Stamper.<br><br><strong>USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:</strong><br>1. Perform a manicure, apply a base/gel polish or color, cure under the lamp;<br>2. If there is a sticky residue, remove it using DARK GEL CLEANSER;<br>3. Apply polish to the plate, use a scraper to remove excess, and transfer the design to the stamper;<br>4. Transfer the design from the stamper to the nail with a rolling or straight motion;<br>5. Apply a top coat (if the top coat slides off the design, first apply a thin layer of transparent base, then the top coat).<br><br><strong>WHY THE DESIGN MAY NOT TRANSFER ONTO THE STAMPER:</strong><br>1. The polish should not be too thick; pick up enough polish on the brush to cover the design;<br>2. Apply polish to the plate in 1-2 motions-applying for too long increases the chance of poor transfer because the polish dries in the air;<br>3. Use the scraper at an angle of about 45 degrees, do not press too hard to avoid pushing polish out of the engraving;<br>4. Scrape quickly (2-4 strokes are enough) without making wide sweeps across the whole plate;<br>5. Quickly put the scraper down and take the stamper in your hand (remember, time is limited when working with stamping polishes);<br>6. Transfer the pattern to the stamper with a gentle rolling motion-DO NOT try to press the stamper hard onto the plate, since the more you press, the more polish remains on the plate.",

The polish should not be thickened, collect enough polish onto the brush so there is enough to spread over the plate;<br>2. Apply the polish to the plate in 1-2 moves; the longer you take, the more likely it is to dry and transfer poorly;<br>3. Use the scraper at an angle of about 45 degrees without pressing hard, so as not to remove polish from the engraving;<br>4. Work swiftly with the scraper (2-4 moves is enough), do not scrape across the entire plate;<br>5. Quickly put down the scraper and take the stamper (remember, when working with polishes, speed is key);<br>6. Pick up the design onto the stamper with a gentle rolling motion; DO NOT press too hard, the more pressure you use, the more polish will remain in the plate.",

Take an adequate amount of polish on the brush, just enough to cover the design.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate with 1-2 movements. The longer you apply it, the higher the chance of a poor transfer because the polish dries in the air.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper at an angle of approximately 45 degrees, without pressing too hard, to avoid \"squeezing out\" the polish from the design.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper quickly (2-4 movements are enough), without a wide swing across the entire plate.</li>\n  <li>Then quickly put down the scraper and grab the stamper (remember, there's no time to waste when working with these polishes).</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design to the stamper with a gentle, rolling motion. DO NOT press the stamper hard into the plate—the harder you press, the more polish will remain on the plate.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Volume:</strong> 10 ml.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Has European and Ukrainian quality certificates.</li>\n  <li>The product is registered in the CPNP system.</li>\n  <li>For professional use only.</li>\n  <li>All DARK products are NOT tested on animals.</li>\n  <li>Use original lamps with all DARK materials.</li>\n  <li>Please read the application instructions carefully before use.</li>\n  <li>The color of the product in the image may differ slightly from the actual color.

Take an adequate amount of polish on the brush, just enough to cover the design.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate with 1-2 movements. The longer you apply it, the higher the chance of a poor transfer because the polish dries in the air.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper at an angle of approximately 45 degrees, without pressing too hard, to avoid \"squeezing out\" the polish from the design.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper quickly (2-4 movements are enough), without a wide swing across the entire plate.</li>\n  <li>Then quickly put down the scraper and grab the stamper (remember, there's no time to waste when working with these polishes).</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design to the stamper with a gentle, rolling motion.

Take an adequate amount of polish on the brush, just enough to cover the design.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate with 1-2 movements. The longer you apply it, the higher the chance of a poor transfer because the polish dries in the air.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper at an angle of approximately 45 degrees, without pressing too hard, to avoid \"squeezing out\" the polish from the design.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper quickly (2-4 movements are enough), without a wide swing across the entire plate.</li>\n  <li>Then quickly put down the scraper and grab the stamper (remember, there's no time to waste when working with these polishes).</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design to the stamper with a gentle, rolling motion. DO NOT press the stamper hard into the plate—the harder you press, the more polish will remain on the plate.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Volume:</strong> 10 ml.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Has European and Ukrainian quality certificates.</li>\n  <li>The product is registered in the CPNP system.</li>\n  <li>For professional use only.</li>\n  <li>All DARK products are NOT tested on animals.</li>\n  <li>Use original lamps with all DARK materials.</li>\n  <li>Please read the application instructions carefully before use.</li>\n  <li>The color of the product in the image may differ slightly from the actual color.

Take an adequate amount of polish on the brush, just enough to cover the design.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate with 1-2 movements. The longer you apply it, the higher the chance of a poor transfer because the polish dries in the air.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper at an angle of approximately 45 degrees, without pressing too hard, to avoid \"squeezing out\" the polish from the design.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper quickly (2-4 movements are enough), without a wide swing across the entire plate.</li>\n  <li>Then quickly put down the scraper and grab the stamper (remember, there's no time to waste when working with these polishes).</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design to the stamper with a gentle, rolling motion.

		"description": "<p><strong>STAMPING POLISH DARK</strong> are highly pigmented stamping polishes that transfer easily with the correct application. They feature a wide color palette, are not thick, and work with all types of stamping tools.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Use</strong></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Complete your manicure, apply a base/gel or colored polish, and cure in a lamp.</li>\n  <li>If there is a tacky layer on the nail, remove it with DARK GEL CLEANSER.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate, scrape off the excess with a scraper, and transfer the design to the stamper.</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design from the stamper to the nail using a rolling or a flat, even motion.</li>\n  <li>Cover with a top coat (if the top coat slides off the design, apply a thin layer of a clear base coat first, and then the top coat).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Why Might the Design Not Transfer to the Stamper?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The polish should not be too thick. Take an adequate amount of polish on the brush, just enough to cover the design.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate with 1-2 movements. The longer you apply it, the higher the chance of a poor transfer because the polish dries in the air.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper at an angle of approximately 45 degrees, without pressing too hard, to avoid \"squeezing out\" the polish from the design.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper quickly (2-4 movements are enough), without a wide swing across the entire plate.</li>\n  <li>Then quickly put down the scraper and grab the stamper (remember, there's no time to waste when working with these polishes).</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design to the stamper with a gentle, rolling motion. DO NOT press the stamper hard into the plate—the harder you press, the more polish will remain on the plate.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Volume:</strong> 10 ml.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Has European and Ukrainian quality certificates.</li>\n  <li>The product is registered in the CPNP system.</li>\n  <li>For professional use only.</li>\n  <li>All DARK products are NOT tested on animals.</li>\n  <li>Use original lamps with all DARK materials.</li>\n  <li>Please read the application instructions carefully before use.</li>\n  <li>The color of the product in the image may differ slightly from the actual color. This is due to individual user screen settings, lighting during the photo shoot, and the technical characteristics of digital color reproduction. We strive to accurately represent the product, but slight variations are possible.</li>\n  <li>The manufacturer may change the composition to improve the formula. You can always find the latest list of ingredients on the product packaging.</li>\n  <li>If you have an allergy or individual intolerance to any of the ingredients, product use is prohibited.

		"description": "<p><strong>STAMPING POLISH DARK</strong> are highly pigmented stamping polishes that transfer easily with the correct application. They feature a wide color palette, are not thick, and work with all types of stamping tools.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Use</strong></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Complete your manicure, apply a base/gel or colored polish, and cure in a lamp.</li>\n  <li>If there is a tacky layer on the nail, remove it with DARK GEL CLEANSER.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate, scrape off the excess with a scraper, and transfer the design to the stamper.</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design from the stamper to the nail using a rolling or a flat, even motion.</li>\n  <li>Cover with a top coat (if the top coat slides off the design, apply a thin layer of a clear base coat first, and then the top coat).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Why Might the Design Not Transfer to the Stamper?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The polish should not be too thick. Take an adequate amount of polish on the brush, just enough to cover the design.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate with 1-2 movements. The longer you apply it, the higher the chance of a poor transfer because the polish dries in the air.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper at an angle of approximately 45 degrees, without pressing too hard, to avoid \"squeezing out\" the polish from the design.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper quickly (2-4 movements are enough), without a wide swing across the entire plate.</li>\n  <li>Then quickly put down the scraper and grab the stamper (remember, there's no time to waste when working with these polishes).</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design to the stamper with a gentle, rolling motion. DO NOT press the stamper hard into the plate—the harder you press, the more polish will remain on the plate.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Volume:</strong> 10 ml.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Has European and Ukrainian quality certificates.</li>\n  <li>The product is registered in the CPNP system.</li>\n  <li>For professional use only.</li>\n  <li>All DARK products are NOT tested on animals.</li>\n  <li>Use original lamps with all DARK materials.</li>\n  <li>Please read the application instructions carefully before use.</li>\n  <li>The color of the product in the image may differ slightly from the actual color.

Remember not to perform leveling with a medium-acid base-only a thin layer-to avoid chemical burns;<br>- We also recommend not applying the camouflaging base immediately, but using a clear base first.<br><br>3.

Take an adequate amount of polish on the brush, just enough to cover the design.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate with 1-2 movements. The longer you apply it, the higher the chance of a poor transfer because the polish dries in the air.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper at an angle of approximately 45 degrees, without pressing too hard, to avoid \"squeezing out\" the polish from the design.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper quickly (2-4 movements are enough), without a wide swing across the entire plate.</li>\n  <li>Then quickly put down the scraper and grab the stamper (remember, there's no time to waste when working with these polishes).</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design to the stamper with a gentle, rolling motion.

They feature a wide color palette, are not thick, and work with all types of stamping tools.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Use</strong></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Complete your manicure, apply a base/gel or colored polish, and cure in a lamp.</li>\n  <li>If there is a tacky layer on the nail, remove it with DARK GEL CLEANSER.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate, scrape off the excess with a scraper, and transfer the design to the stamper.</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design from the stamper to the nail using a rolling or a flat, even motion.</li>\n  <li>Cover with a top coat (if the top coat slides off the design, apply a thin layer of a clear base coat first, and then the top coat).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Why Might the Design Not Transfer to the Stamper?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The polish should not be too thick.

Take an adequate amount of polish on the brush, just enough to cover the design.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate with 1-2 movements. The longer you apply it, the higher the chance of a poor transfer because the polish dries in the air.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper at an angle of approximately 45 degrees, without pressing too hard, to avoid \"squeezing out\" the polish from the design.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper quickly (2-4 movements are enough), without a wide swing across the entire plate.</li>\n  <li>Then quickly put down the scraper and grab the stamper (remember, there's no time to waste when working with these polishes).</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design to the stamper with a gentle, rolling motion.

They feature a wide color palette, are not thick, and work with all types of stamping tools.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Use</strong></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Complete your manicure, apply a base/gel or colored polish, and cure in a lamp.</li>\n  <li>If there is a tacky layer on the nail, remove it with DARK GEL CLEANSER.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate, scrape off the excess with a scraper, and transfer the design to the stamper.</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design from the stamper to the nail using a rolling or a flat, even motion.</li>\n  <li>Cover with a top coat (if the top coat slides off the design, apply a thin layer of a clear base coat first, and then the top coat).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Why Might the Design Not Transfer to the Stamper?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The polish should not be too thick. Take an adequate amount of polish on the brush, just enough to cover the design.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate with 1-2 movements. The longer you apply it, the higher the chance of a poor transfer because the polish dries in the air.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper at an angle of approximately 45 degrees, without pressing too hard, to avoid \"squeezing out\" the polish from the design.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper quickly (2-4 movements are enough), without a wide swing across the entire plate.</li>\n  <li>Then quickly put down the scraper and grab the stamper (remember, there's no time to waste when working with these polishes).</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design to the stamper with a gentle, rolling motion. DO NOT press the stamper hard into the plate—the harder you press, the more polish will remain on the plate.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Volume:</strong> 10 ml.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Has European and Ukrainian quality certificates.</li>\n  <li>The product is registered in the CPNP system.</li>\n  <li>For professional use only.</li>\n  <li>All DARK products are NOT tested on animals.</li>\n  <li>Use original lamps with all DARK materials.</li>\n  <li>Please read the application instructions carefully before use.</li>\n  <li>The color of the product in the image may differ slightly from the actual color. This is due to individual user screen settings, lighting during the photo shoot, and the technical characteristics of digital color reproduction. We strive to accurately represent the product, but slight variations are possible.</li>\n  <li>The manufacturer may change the composition to improve the formula.

They feature a wide color palette, are not thick, and work with all types of stamping tools.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Use</strong></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Complete your manicure, apply a base/gel or colored polish, and cure in a lamp.</li>\n  <li>If there is a tacky layer on the nail, remove it with DARK GEL CLEANSER.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate, scrape off the excess with a scraper, and transfer the design to the stamper.</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design from the stamper to the nail using a rolling or a flat, even motion.</li>\n  <li>Cover with a top coat (if the top coat slides off the design, apply a thin layer of a clear base coat first, and then the top coat).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Why Might the Design Not Transfer to the Stamper?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The polish should not be too thick. Take an adequate amount of polish on the brush, just enough to cover the design.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate with 1-2 movements. The longer you apply it, the higher the chance of a poor transfer because the polish dries in the air.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper at an angle of approximately 45 degrees, without pressing too hard, to avoid \"squeezing out\" the polish from the design.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper quickly (2-4 movements are enough), without a wide swing across the entire plate.</li>\n  <li>Then quickly put down the scraper and grab the stamper (remember, there's no time to waste when working with these polishes).</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design to the stamper with a gentle, rolling motion. DO NOT press the stamper hard into the plate—the harder you press, the more polish will remain on the plate.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Volume:</strong> 10 ml.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Has European and Ukrainian quality certificates.</li>\n  <li>The product is registered in the CPNP system.</li>\n  <li>For professional use only.</li>\n  <li>All DARK products are NOT tested on animals.</li>\n  <li>Use original lamps with all DARK materials.</li>\n  <li>Please read the application instructions carefully before use.</li>\n  <li>The color of the product in the image may differ slightly from the actual color.

		"description": "<strong>DARK PRO BASE</strong> is a low-acid, medium-consistency camouflage base designed for applying a thin or medium layer onto the nail.<br><br><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong><br>- Low-acid (pH 6.5) camouflage base;<br>- Pigmentation level from 1 to 3.5 (on a 4-point scale), cures well;<br>- Does not delaminate over time;<br>- Does not cause intense burning in the lamp;<br>- Consistency is closer to liquid, which allows for fast and thin leveling;<br>- Flexible rather than rigid.<br><br><strong>APPLICATION METHOD:</strong><br>1. Perform manicure, buff and degrease the nail, apply Ultrabond and Dehydrator;<br><br>2. Before applying PRO BASE, apply a thin layer of transparent base SCOTCH BASE (or another medium-acid base) for better adhesion:<br>- This is important because medium-acid base is required for adhesion with natural nails. Please note, medium-acid bases are used only for a thin layer, not for leveling, to prevent chemical burns;<br>- We also recommend not applying the camouflage base directly, but starting with a transparent layer.<br><br>3. Apply a thin or leveling layer of DARK PRO BASE. The layer thickness should not exceed 0.7 mm. Cure for 60-90 seconds at 48W;<br>- For all DARK materials, it is important to use original lamps.<br><br>4. Apply a top coat and cure for 90 seconds.<br><br><strong>USAGE NOTES:</strong><br>- We do not recommend covering long, very thin nails or perfectly square-shaped nails with sharp corners using base gels. For such nails, use hard materials;<br>- If the client needs to shorten their nails, it&#8217;s best done after applying top coat (by 1 mm), as this will result in a slightly thicker free edge and improved wear.<br><br>Available in two sizes: 15 ml with brush / 30 ml without brush.<br><br>Certified to European and Ukrainian quality standards, registered in the CPNP system, all DARK products are NOT tested on animals.<br><br><strong>IMPORTANT NOTES:</strong><br>Before use, be sure to read the application instructions carefully.

Perform manicure and apply base/gel or color, cure in a lamp;<br>2. If there is a sticky inhibition layer, remove it with <em>DARK GEL CLEANSER</em>;<br>3. Apply polish onto the plate, use a scraper to remove the excess, and transfer the design onto the stamper;<br>4. Transfer the pattern from the stamper to the nail with a rolling or gentle motion;<br>5. Cover with a top coat (if the top coat runs off the design, apply a thin layer of clear base first, then the top coat).<br><br><strong>WHY THE DESIGN MIGHT NOT TRANSFER TO THE STAMPER:</strong><br>1. The polish should not be too thick. Do not pick up too little polish on the brush; there should be enough to cover the design;<br>2. Apply the polish to the plate in 1-2 strokes. The longer you apply, the more likely it is to dry before stamping;<br>3. Use the scraper at a ~45-degree angle and do not press hard to avoid pulling polish out of the design;<br>4. Scrape quickly (2-4 motions is enough) and do not sweep over the entire plate;<br>5. Immediately put the scraper down and pick up the stamper-timing is crucial when working with stamping polishes;<br>6. Transfer the design to the stamper with a soft rolling motion. <strong>DO NOT</strong> try to forcefully press the stamper into the plate, as more polish will remain on the plate.",

Perform manicure, buff, degrease the nail, apply Ultrabond and Dehydrator.<br><br>2. Before applying PRO BASE, apply a thin layer of a transparent base such as SCOTCH BASE (or another medium-acid base) for better adhesion:<br>- This is important because medium-acid bases are needed for adhesion to natural nails. Remember, medium-acid base is for a thin layer only, not for leveling, to avoid chemical burns;<br>- We also recommend not to apply camouflage base directly to the nail, but to start with transparent base.<br><br>3. Apply a thin or leveling layer of DARK PRO BASE. The layer should not exceed 0.7 mm.

They feature a wide color palette, are not thick, and work with all types of stamping tools.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Use</strong></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Complete your manicure, apply a base/gel or colored polish, and cure in a lamp.</li>\n  <li>If there is a tacky layer on the nail, remove it with DARK GEL CLEANSER.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate, scrape off the excess with a scraper, and transfer the design to the stamper.</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design from the stamper to the nail using a rolling or a flat, even motion.</li>\n  <li>Cover with a top coat (if the top coat slides off the design, apply a thin layer of a clear base coat first, and then the top coat).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Why Might the Design Not Transfer to the Stamper?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The polish should not be too thick. Take an adequate amount of polish on the brush, just enough to cover the design.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate with 1-2 movements. The longer you apply it, the higher the chance of a poor transfer because the polish dries in the air.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper at an angle of approximately 45 degrees, without pressing too hard, to avoid \"squeezing out\" the polish from the design.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper quickly (2-4 movements are enough), without a wide swing across the entire plate.</li>\n  <li>Then quickly put down the scraper and grab the stamper (remember, there's no time to waste when working with these polishes).</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design to the stamper with a gentle, rolling motion. DO NOT press the stamper hard into the plate—the harder you press, the more polish will remain on the plate.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Volume:</strong> 10 ml.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Has European and Ukrainian quality certificates.</li>\n  <li>The product is registered in the CPNP system.</li>\n  <li>For professional use only.</li>\n  <li>All DARK products are NOT tested on animals.</li>\n  <li>Use original lamps with all DARK materials.</li>\n  <li>Please read the application instructions carefully before use.</li>\n  <li>The color of the product in the image may differ slightly from the actual color.

They feature a wide color palette, are not thick, and work with all types of stamping tools.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Use</strong></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Complete your manicure, apply a base/gel or colored polish, and cure in a lamp.</li>\n  <li>If there is a tacky layer on the nail, remove it with DARK GEL CLEANSER.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate, scrape off the excess with a scraper, and transfer the design to the stamper.</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design from the stamper to the nail using a rolling or a flat, even motion.</li>\n  <li>Cover with a top coat (if the top coat slides off the design, apply a thin layer of a clear base coat first, and then the top coat).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Why Might the Design Not Transfer to the Stamper?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The polish should not be too thick. Take an adequate amount of polish on the brush, just enough to cover the design.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate with 1-2 movements. The longer you apply it, the higher the chance of a poor transfer because the polish dries in the air.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper at an angle of approximately 45 degrees, without pressing too hard, to avoid \"squeezing out\" the polish from the design.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper quickly (2-4 movements are enough), without a wide swing across the entire plate.</li>\n  <li>Then quickly put down the scraper and grab the stamper (remember, there's no time to waste when working with these polishes).</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design to the stamper with a gentle, rolling motion. DO NOT press the stamper hard into the plate—the harder you press, the more polish will remain on the plate.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Volume:</strong> 10 ml.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Has European and Ukrainian quality certificates.</li>\n  <li>The product is registered in the CPNP system.</li>\n  <li>For professional use only.</li>\n  <li>All DARK products are NOT tested on animals.</li>\n  <li>Use original lamps with all DARK materials.</li>\n  <li>Please read the application instructions carefully before use.</li>\n  <li>The color of the product in the image may differ slightly from the actual color.

Take an adequate amount of polish on the brush, just enough to cover the design.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate with 1-2 movements. The longer you apply it, the higher the chance of a poor transfer because the polish dries in the air.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper at an angle of approximately 45 degrees, without pressing too hard, to avoid \"squeezing out\" the polish from the design.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper quickly (2-4 movements are enough), without a wide swing across the entire plate.</li>\n  <li>Then quickly put down the scraper and grab the stamper (remember, there's no time to waste when working with these polishes).</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design to the stamper with a gentle, rolling motion. DO NOT press the stamper hard into the plate—the harder you press, the more polish will remain on the plate.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Volume:</strong> 10 ml.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Has European and Ukrainian quality certificates.</li>\n  <li>The product is registered in the CPNP system.</li>\n  <li>For professional use only.</li>\n  <li>All DARK products are NOT tested on animals.</li>\n  <li>Use original lamps with all DARK materials.</li>\n  <li>Please read the application instructions carefully before use.</li>\n  <li>The color of the product in the image may differ slightly from the actual color.

Prepare the manicure, apply base/gel or color, and cure under a lamp;<br>2. If a sticky tacky layer is present, remove it using <strong>DARK GEL CLEANSER</strong>;<br>3. Apply polish to the plate, scrape off the excess with a scraper, and transfer the design onto the stamper;<br>4. Transfer the design from the stamper to the nail using a rolling or straight movement;<br>5. Apply a top coat (if the top coat runs off the design, apply a thin layer of clear base first, then the top coat).<br><br><strong>WHY THE DESIGN MIGHT NOT TRANSFER TO THE STAMPER:</strong><br>1. The polish should not be too thick; apply enough polish to the brush to adequately cover the design;<br>2. Apply polish to the plate in 1-2 motions; the longer it takes, the less likely the design will transfer clearly, as the polish dries in air;<br>3. Use the scraper at an approximately 45-degree angle without pressing hard to avoid pushing the polish out of the design;<br>4. Work quickly with the scraper (2-4 passes are enough), without making sweeping motions across the entire plate;<br>5. Quickly set aside the scraper and take the stamper in hand (remember, when working with polish, you have limited time);<br>6. Transfer the design to the stamper with a gentle rolling motion; do NOT try to press the stamper too hard onto the plate-the more you press, the more polish remains on the plate.",

		"description": "<p><strong>STAMPING POLISH DARK</strong> are highly pigmented stamping polishes that transfer easily with the correct application. They feature a wide color palette, are not thick, and work with all types of stamping tools.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Use</strong></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Complete your manicure, apply a base/gel or colored polish, and cure in a lamp.</li>\n  <li>If there is a tacky layer on the nail, remove it with DARK GEL CLEANSER.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate, scrape off the excess with a scraper, and transfer the design to the stamper.</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design from the stamper to the nail using a rolling or a flat, even motion.</li>\n  <li>Cover with a top coat (if the top coat slides off the design, apply a thin layer of a clear base coat first, and then the top coat).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Why Might the Design Not Transfer to the Stamper?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The polish should not be too thick. Take an adequate amount of polish on the brush, just enough to cover the design.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate with 1-2 movements. The longer you apply it, the higher the chance of a poor transfer because the polish dries in the air.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper at an angle of approximately 45 degrees, without pressing too hard, to avoid \"squeezing out\" the polish from the design.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper quickly (2-4 movements are enough), without a wide swing across the entire plate.</li>\n  <li>Then quickly put down the scraper and grab the stamper (remember, there's no time to waste when working with these polishes).</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design to the stamper with a gentle, rolling motion. DO NOT press the stamper hard into the plate—the harder you press, the more polish will remain on the plate.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Volume:</strong> 10 ml.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Has European and Ukrainian quality certificates.</li>\n  <li>The product is registered in the CPNP system.</li>\n  <li>For professional use only.</li>\n  <li>All DARK products are NOT tested on animals.</li>\n  <li>Use original lamps with all DARK materials.</li>\n  <li>Please read the application instructions carefully before use.</li>\n  <li>The color of the product in the image may differ slightly from the actual color. This is due to individual user screen settings, lighting during the photo shoot, and the technical characteristics of digital color reproduction. We strive to accurately represent the product, but slight variations are possible.</li>\n  <li>The manufacturer may change the composition to improve the formula. You can always find the latest list of ingredients on the product packaging.</li>\n  <li>If you have an allergy or individual intolerance to any of the ingredients, product use is prohibited. In such cases, consult a doctor before use.</li>\n  <li>Main ingredients: Butyl Acetate, Ethyl Acetate, Acrylates Copolymer, Acetyl Tributyl Citrate.</li>\n  <li>The full product composition is listed on the label.

Take an adequate amount of polish on the brush, just enough to cover the design.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate with 1-2 movements. The longer you apply it, the higher the chance of a poor transfer because the polish dries in the air.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper at an angle of approximately 45 degrees, without pressing too hard, to avoid \"squeezing out\" the polish from the design.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper quickly (2-4 movements are enough), without a wide swing across the entire plate.</li>\n  <li>Then quickly put down the scraper and grab the stamper (remember, there's no time to waste when working with these polishes).</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design to the stamper with a gentle, rolling motion.

They feature a wide color palette, are not thick, and work with all types of stamping tools.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Use</strong></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Complete your manicure, apply a base/gel or colored polish, and cure in a lamp.</li>\n  <li>If there is a tacky layer on the nail, remove it with DARK GEL CLEANSER.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate, scrape off the excess with a scraper, and transfer the design to the stamper.</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design from the stamper to the nail using a rolling or a flat, even motion.</li>\n  <li>Cover with a top coat (if the top coat slides off the design, apply a thin layer of a clear base coat first, and then the top coat).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Why Might the Design Not Transfer to the Stamper?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The polish should not be too thick. Take an adequate amount of polish on the brush, just enough to cover the design.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate with 1-2 movements. The longer you apply it, the higher the chance of a poor transfer because the polish dries in the air.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper at an angle of approximately 45 degrees, without pressing too hard, to avoid \"squeezing out\" the polish from the design.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper quickly (2-4 movements are enough), without a wide swing across the entire plate.</li>\n  <li>Then quickly put down the scraper and grab the stamper (remember, there's no time to waste when working with these polishes).</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design to the stamper with a gentle, rolling motion. DO NOT press the stamper hard into the plate—the harder you press, the more polish will remain on the plate.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Volume:</strong> 10 ml.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Has European and Ukrainian quality certificates.</li>\n  <li>The product is registered in the CPNP system.</li>\n  <li>For professional use only.</li>\n  <li>All DARK products are NOT tested on animals.</li>\n  <li>Use original lamps with all DARK materials.</li>\n  <li>Please read the application instructions carefully before use.</li>\n  <li>The color of the product in the image may differ slightly from the actual color. This is due to individual user screen settings, lighting during the photo shoot, and the technical characteristics of digital color reproduction. We strive to accurately represent the product, but slight variations are possible.</li>\n  <li>The manufacturer may change the composition to improve the formula.

Before applying PRO BASE, apply a thin layer of transparent base SCOTCH BASE (or another medium-acidity base) to improve adhesion:<br>- This is important because adhesion to natural nails requires a medium-acidity base. Remember, a medium-acidity base should only be used as a thin layer, not for levelling, to avoid chemical burns;<br>- We also recommend not applying the camouflaging base directly, but first using the transparent base.<br><br>3. Apply a thin or levelling layer of DARK PRO BASE. The layer should not exceed 0.7 mm. Curing time is 60-90 seconds at 48W;<br>- It is important to use original DARK lamps with all DARK materials.<br><br>4. Apply the top coat and cure for 90 seconds.<br><br><strong>WORKING TIPS:</strong><br>- We do not recommend using base coats on long, very thin nails or for a sharp square shape with pointed corners. For such nails, we recommend using hard materials;<br>- If the client arrives with nail length that needs to be reduced, we recommend shortening after applying the top coat (by about 1 mm) - this will make the free edge slightly thicker and improve wear.<br><br>Available in two volumes - 15 ml with brush / 30 ml without brush.<br><br>Certified according to European and Ukrainian quality standards. The product is registered in the CPNP system. All DARK products are cruelty-free.<br><br><strong>IMPORTANT NOTES:</strong><br>Before use, carefully read the instructions for application. If you have an allergy or individual intolerance to any component of this product, do not use it. In such cases, consult your physician before use.<br><br>*The manufacturer may change the product formula to improve it.

Take an adequate amount of polish on the brush, just enough to cover the design.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate with 1-2 movements. The longer you apply it, the higher the chance of a poor transfer because the polish dries in the air.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper at an angle of approximately 45 degrees, without pressing too hard, to avoid \"squeezing out\" the polish from the design.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper quickly (2-4 movements are enough), without a wide swing across the entire plate.</li>\n  <li>Then quickly put down the scraper and grab the stamper (remember, there's no time to waste when working with these polishes).</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design to the stamper with a gentle, rolling motion.

The longer you apply it, the higher the chance of a poor transfer because the polish dries in the air.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper at an angle of approximately 45 degrees, without pressing too hard, to avoid \"squeezing out\" the polish from the design.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper quickly (2-4 movements are enough), without a wide swing across the entire plate.</li>\n  <li>Then quickly put down the scraper and grab the stamper (remember, there's no time to waste when working with these polishes).</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design to the stamper with a gentle, rolling motion. DO NOT press the stamper hard into the plate—the harder you press, the more polish will remain on the plate.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Volume:</strong> 10 ml.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Has European and Ukrainian quality certificates.</li>\n  <li>The product is registered in the CPNP system.</li>\n  <li>For professional use only.</li>\n  <li>All DARK products are NOT tested on animals.</li>\n  <li>Use original lamps with all DARK materials.</li>\n  <li>Please read the application instructions carefully before use.</li>\n  <li>The color of the product in the image may differ slightly from the actual color.

They feature a wide color palette, are not thick, and work with all types of stamping tools.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Use</strong></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Complete your manicure, apply a base/gel or colored polish, and cure in a lamp.</li>\n  <li>If there is a tacky layer on the nail, remove it with DARK GEL CLEANSER.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate, scrape off the excess with a scraper, and transfer the design to the stamper.</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design from the stamper to the nail using a rolling or a flat, even motion.</li>\n  <li>Cover with a top coat (if the top coat slides off the design, apply a thin layer of a clear base coat first, and then the top coat).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Why Might the Design Not Transfer to the Stamper?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The polish should not be too thick. Take an adequate amount of polish on the brush, just enough to cover the design.</li>\n  <li>Apply the polish to the plate with 1-2 movements. The longer you apply it, the higher the chance of a poor transfer because the polish dries in the air.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper at an angle of approximately 45 degrees, without pressing too hard, to avoid \"squeezing out\" the polish from the design.</li>\n  <li>Work with the scraper quickly (2-4 movements are enough), without a wide swing across the entire plate.</li>\n  <li>Then quickly put down the scraper and grab the stamper (remember, there's no time to waste when working with these polishes).</li>\n  <li>Transfer the design to the stamper with a gentle, rolling motion. DO NOT press the stamper hard into the plate—the harder you press, the more polish will remain on the plate.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Volume:</strong> 10 ml.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Has European and Ukrainian quality certificates.</li>\n  <li>The product is registered in the CPNP system.</li>\n  <li>For professional use only.</li>\n  <li>All DARK products are NOT tested on animals.</li>\n  <li>Use original lamps with all DARK materials.</li>\n  <li>Please read the application instructions carefully before use.</li>\n  <li>The color of the product in the image may differ slightly from the actual color.

Perform manicure, buff, degrease the nail, apply Ultrabond and Dehydrator.<br><br>2. Before applying PRO BASE, apply a thin layer of clear SCOTCH BASE (or other medium-acidic base) as an underlayer for better adhesion:<br>- This is important because medium-acidic base ensures adhesion to the natural nail; remember, medium-acidic base should be applied only as a thin layer, and not used for leveling to avoid chemical burns;<br>- We also recommend not applying the camouflaging base directly on the nail, but to use a clear base first.<br><br>3. Apply a thin or leveling layer of DARK PRO BASE. The layer should be no thicker than 0.7 mm. Polymerization time is 60-90 seconds at 48W;<br>- For all DARK materials, it is important to use original lamps.<br><br>4. Apply the top coat and cure for 90 seconds.<br><br><strong>WORKING TIPS:</strong><br>- We do not recommend using these bases for long, very thin nails or sharp-cornered square shapes. For such nails, use hard products;<br>- If the client’s nails are long and need shortening, it is recommended to file after the top coat (1 mm), this makes the edge slightly thicker and prolongs product wear.<br><br>Available in two volumes: 15 ml with brush / 30 ml without brush.<br><br>Certified according to European and Ukrainian standards.
