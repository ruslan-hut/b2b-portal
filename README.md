## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (v9 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd b2b-portal/b2b-portal
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
ng serve
```

4. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser

## Development

### Development Server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code Scaffolding

Generate new components:
```bash
ng generate component component-name
ng generate service service-name
ng generate module module-name
```

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running Tests

```bash
ng test              # Unit tests
ng e2e               # End-to-end tests (when configured)
```

## Usage

### Testing with Mock Data

The application includes comprehensive mock data for testing all features before API integration.

** See [MOCK_DATA.md](./MOCK_DATA.md) for detailed information about:**
- Available test users and login credentials
- Complete product catalog (15 products across 3 categories)
- Sample orders with various statuses
- Testing scenarios and tips

### Quick Start - Demo Credentials

Login with any of these test accounts:
- **Admin**: `admin@example.com` (any password)
- **Client**: `client@example.com` (any password)
- **Demo**: `demo@example.com` (any password)

### Key Features

1. **Product Browsing**
   - Search products by name, description, or category
   - View product details including price, SKU, and availability
   - Add products to cart directly from catalog

2. **Shopping Cart**
   - Side panel with cart items
   - Adjust quantities or remove items
   - See real-time total calculation
   - Proceed to checkout

3. **Order Confirmation**
   - Review cart items
   - Enter shipping address
   - Submit order
   - Receive order confirmation

4. **Order History**
   - View all past orders
   - See order status and details
   - Track order timeline

## API Integration

Currently, the application uses mock data located in `src/app/core/mock-data/`. To integrate with a real API:

1. Update the service files in `src/app/core/services/`
2. Replace mock implementations with HTTP calls
3. Configure API base URL in environment files
4. Add proper error handling and retry logic

Example:
```typescript
// Before (mock)
return of(MOCK_PRODUCTS).pipe(delay(500));

// After (real API)
return this.http.get<Product[]>(`${this.apiUrl}/products`).pipe(
  retry(1),
  catchError(this.handleError)
);
```

See [MOCK_DATA.md](./MOCK_DATA.md) for complete details on the mock data structure.

## Configuration

### Environment Files

- `environment.ts` - Development environment
- `environment.prod.ts` - Production environment

Configure API endpoints and other settings in these files.
